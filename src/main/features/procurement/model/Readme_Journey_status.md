# Journey status 

Journey service is used to store our journey status information (POST, PUT & GET).

# Flow

First when we load the procurement page we have to issue the `POST` method to initiate default journey status for the procurement.

`POST` Create Journey:

    curl --location --request POST 'https://dev-ccs-scale-cat-service.london.cloudapps.digital/journeys' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer ...' \
    --data-raw '{
        "journey-id": "ocds-abc-457",
        "states": [
            {
                "step": 1,
                "state": "Not started"
            },
            {
                "step": 2,
                "state": "Not started"
            },
            {
                "step": 3,
                "state": "Optional"
            }
        ]
    }'
`PUT` Update journey state step:

     curl --location --request PUT 'https://dev-ccs-scale-cat-service.london.cloudapps.digital/journeys/ocds-abc-457/steps/2' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer ...' \
    --data-raw '"In progress"

`GET` journey state:

    curl --location --request GET 'https://dev-ccs-scale-cat-service.london.cloudapps.digital/journeys/ocds-abc-457/steps' \ 2--header 'Authorization: Bearer ...'

> Journey ID should be the projectID - e.g. `1234`
